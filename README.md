# Path-Dependent Volatility:
Non-Parametric Kernel Estimation and Smoothing for EPEX Spot Prediction

This project focuses on estimating path-dependent volatility using non-parametric kernel estimation techniques. By applying smoothing methods, we aim to develop predictive models for the EPEX Spot electricity price based on the historical path of France's annual electricity consumption. This approach helps capture non-linear dependencies between electricity consumption and price volatility, allowing for more accurate forecasts and better insights into the dynamics of the energy market.

## Features

- **Non-Parametric Kernel Estimation**: Implements non-parametric methods to estimate the kernel representing the relationship between past consumption patterns and current price volatility.
- **Smoothing Techniques**: Applies smoothing to enhance kernel estimation accuracy, reducing noise and refining the signal for volatility prediction.
- **EPEX Spot Prediction Model**: Predicts EPEX Spot electricity prices based on historical annual electricity consumption data for France.
