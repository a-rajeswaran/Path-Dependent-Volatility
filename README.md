# Path-Dependent-Volatility
We explore volatility patterns in financial time series that depend on the historical path taken by asset prices. The project includes modeling, analysis, and simulations to help visualize how path-dependence affects asset price volatility, with applications to options pricing, risk management, and financial forecasting.
